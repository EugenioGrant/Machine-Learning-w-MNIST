KNN is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. However keep in mind that KNNâ€™s main disadvantage is that it becomes significantly slower as the volume of data increases which makes it an impractical choice in environments where predictions need to be made rapidly.

This is a notebook that shows how to train a ML model and use the KNN algorithm to identify handwritten digits. Default parameters are from sklearn while tested k = 2. This is a work in progress so feel free to improve it. I'll be adding two more models, SVM and Random Forest to see if improvements are possible, which most likely it's the case.
